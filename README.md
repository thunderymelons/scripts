# scripts
#localipscan scans your local network relatively quickly but i later found out that i could just do 192.168.0.0/16 instead of that whole script

#hard driver wrties files to a hard drive you designate so that its always spinning and you dont have to wait for it to spin up when you want to access it again

#checklist is just a checklist u can check off for what you want to get done for the day. you can make it open on start up so that you can check it off and be done for the day when you are done.
#MAKE SURE that you have a file called "tracker_counter.txt" in the same folder as this script with a simple 0 on the first line and nothing else
